Python language behavior is calibrated against CPython 3.14.5, distributed
under the Python Software Foundation License. Strict identifier validation
uses `unicode-ident` under its MIT OR Apache-2.0 license.

Identifier NFKC normalization uses `unicode-normalization` 0.1.24 and its
Unicode 16.0.0 tables, distributed under the MIT OR Apache-2.0 license.

Named Unicode escape lookup uses `unicode_names2` 2.0.0 and its Unicode 16.0.0
tables, distributed under the MIT OR Apache-2.0 and Unicode-DFS-2016 licenses.
Formal name aliases are generated from Unicode's `NameAliases-16.0.0.txt`,
distributed under the Unicode Terms of Use identified in that data file.
